  <h4>My 1st steps</h4>
  I am  starting webdeveloper who has multiple years of programming experience. <br>
  Starting with VBA to build a Custom Asset Management system <br>
  Later getting the intereset in creating website.<br>
  Starting with various CMS systems but always ending at a point that it is not satisfying the needs.<br /
 </p>

<p>
  To get more control what you get what I wanted started to learn the web developement basics and start using PHP<br />
  This was a great way to build the website, customize the design with CSS and use a MySQL database as source for the content.<br />
  To fill the database i was still using MS-Access because i was very familiar how to build the forms i wanted to enter the data and rerports<br>
</p>
<p>
  Now it is time to expand the knowledge of building interactive website.<br>
  Make it possible to transform the current MS-Access database into a fully website driven system.< /br>
  Including User Authentication / Access Control and report creation
</p>
<p> 
  <h4>The Present process></h4>
  To get me where i wanted to be , found the nice Learning Experience website to help me involve and improve my skills
